**CALCULATE THE OUTPUT!**
* (Repository Name on GitHub: calculate_the_output)
* A game that makes the player calculate the output of a given function and input.


# FEATURES and CHANGELOG

> **Version 1.1.2**
* Some text shown to the player was replaced, as it might offend some people.
* More minor bugs were fixed.

> **Version 1.1.1**
* Some minor bugs were fixed.

> **Version 1.1.0**
* Released: 2023-07-31
* Functions with fractional coefficients/input added.
* Levels 3, 4, and 5 were added, making it a total of 6.

> **Version 1.0.0**
(Only .py and .exe versions are available)

* Released: 2023-07-29
* The game involves making the user calculate the function value with coefficients and input that are natural numbers, nonzero integers, or fractions (in which the numerator and denominator are nonzero integers), depending on the level.
* Levels 0-2 exist. Level 0 is the easiest; level 2 is the hardest.

> **Basic Properties that are never going to change**
* Coding Language: Python
* Python installation is required to play.
* There are no additional modules for the player to install.

# FUTURE CHANGES THAT WILL BE MADE
* Features that make the user calculate the function value with fractional coefficients and input.
* The maximum degree of the function will 9.
* More than 20 levels (as creating a new level takes approximately 5 seconds...)
* The time limit will be added to challenge the user mentally.
* If the user makes a mistake in the calculation or fails to complete it within the time limit, the functionality displays 'failure,' giving the user a sense of frustration.
